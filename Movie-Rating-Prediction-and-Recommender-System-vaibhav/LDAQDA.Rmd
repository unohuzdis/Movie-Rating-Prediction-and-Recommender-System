```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
movies <- read.csv(file = "IMDB-Movie-Data.csv")
attach(movies)
slr <- lm(Rank ~ Revenue..Millions.) 
summary(slr)
```

## Fixing NA values
varibale named NewMovieDS has no NA values
```{r}

any(is.na(movies))
sum(is.na(movies))
colSums(is.na(movies))
NewMovieDS <- na.omit(movies)
any(is.na(NewMovieDS))
nrow(NewMovieDS)
```

## LDA

```{r}
library(MASS)
movies <- read.csv(file = "IMDB-Movie-Data.csv")
attach(movies)
mylda <- lda(Rank ~ Revenue..Millions.)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
